# Bike-Sales-Project-With-SQL-Tableau
## Introduction:
In the dynamic retail industry, making decisions based on data is critical to any company's long-term success. This study examines a dataset from a SQL bike store database that is centered on bike sales in three different states. Important variables, including clients, order details, revenue, product details, and sales agents are all included in the dataset. The main objective is to use both SQL queries and Tableau visualizations to turn this raw data into useful insights.
# Research Context:
The dataset originates from a comprehensive SQL bike store database consisting of six interconnected tables: production.brand, production.categories, production.products, and production. Stocks, sales.customers, sales.order_items, sales.orders, sales.staff, and sales.stores Each table plays a pivotal role in providing a holistic view of the bike sales process, from production details to customer transactions. The aim is to extract valuable insights that guide strategic decision-making, particularly in the context of revenue generation across different states, periods, categories, brands, stores, and sales representatives.
## Aim (Objective):
The main goal is to use Tableau to visually portray these insights and to create SQL queries that effectively retrieve pertinent information from the database. By doing this, the analysis hopes to provide the executive team with a thorough grasp of the variables affecting bike sales income. A deeper examination of patterns and trends is made possible by the smooth transition from unstructured data to insightful visuals made possible by the combination of Tableau and SQL.
